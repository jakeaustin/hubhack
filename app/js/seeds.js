    description: "Any business operating in the City of Boston  must file a Business Certificate form, also known as a Doing Business As (DBA) form, with the Office of the City Clerk - unless the business is registered as a Corporation in the State of  Massachusetts.    To register your business with the City of Boston, you must submit a notarized Business Certificate form to the Office of the City Clerk. The form must be signed by each of the business owners and each signature must be notarized individually. You can download the form here:   http://www.cityofboston.gov/cityclerk/BusinessRegistration/ For further information, please call the City Clerk's office at 617-635-4600. You may also need to register with State and Federal Governments.  For additional information, visit  www.mass.gov  and enter _x001C_Business Obligations_x001D_ in the search box.",

  // do you have a federal tax id #
  {
    description: "An Employer Identification Number (EIN) is also known as a Federal Tax Identification Number, and is used to identify a business entity. This number is used for both federal and state tax purposes. Businesses that must obtain an EIN number include: sole proprietorships with one or more employees (not including yourself), and partnerships and corporations with or without employees. Sole proprietorships without employees (other than the owner) that are required to file excise, alcohol, tobacco, firearms, or employment tax returns must also obtain a federal employer identification number. A married couple running a business together (with or without employees) is considered a partnership, not a sole proprietorship, and must obtain an EIN. Exception: If your business is a sole proprietorship without employees (other than the owner) and is not required to file excise, alcohol, tobacco, or firearm tax returns, you do not need to obtain a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). Your social security number can be utilized for business tax purposes. To obtain a federal identification number, you must file Form SS-4, Application for Employer Identification Number, with the Internal Revenue Service. You can apply online at  www.irs.gov/businesses/small/ , or over the phone by calling 800-829-4933.",

  //Do you know what the zoning code does and does not allow you to do in your space?
  {
    description: "Zoning determines how property can be used.   It is very important to ensure, before starting the permitting process, that what you_x0019_re planning on doing is allowed on your property under current zoning.   You can do that by attending one of the Inspectional Services Department's weekly zoning clinics: http://www.cityofboston.gov/isd/building/boa/zoningclinic.asp If a project does not fit the requirements of the Zoning Code, the Board of Appeal may grant relief from strict interpretations of the Code. Relief is granted after a public hearing and a finding that the proposed project is in harmony with the legal zoning in the neighborhood.   To learn more about the appeals process, see: http://www.cityofboston.gov/isd/building/boa/pdfs/Zoning_Booklet.pdf For more resources on zoning, visit: http://www.bostonredevelopmentauthority.org/zoning/zoning.asp http://www.cityofboston.gov/isd/building/boa/zoningclinic.asp http://gis.cityofboston.gov/zoning/",
